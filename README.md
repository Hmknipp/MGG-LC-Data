# MGG-LC-Data


Datasets:
1. `gg-mgg-all-data.csv` - All MGG and GG Data.
2. `gg-mgg-all-w-data.csv` - All data from GG and data that was classified as either (W), (G), or (L) within the Damron Guides. 
3. `gg-mgg-alldata-relative.csv` - All MGG and GG Data by publication and city for each year. Relative percentage is the count of the number of locations within that city divided by the total locations in that year of the publication. For example, Anchorage, Alaska had 12 locations in the 1983 Damron Guide. Dividing this number by the total locations in the 1983 guides gives us a relative percentage of 22.65. 
4. `gg-mgg-relative-all-w-data.csv` - Same relative percentage as described above but for only the locations which Damron classified as (W), (G), or (L).
